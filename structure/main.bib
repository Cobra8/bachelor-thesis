  abstract = {Indexes are models: a btree-Index can be seen as a model to map a key to the position
  of a record within a sorted array, a Hash-Index as a model to map a key to a position
  of a record within an unsorted array, and a BitMap-Index as a model to indicate if
  a data record exists or not. In this exploratory research paper, we start from this
  premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types
  of models, including deep-learning models, which we term em learned indexes. We theoretically
  analyze under which conditions learned indexes outperform traditional index structures
  and describe the main challenges in designing learned index structures. Our initial
  results show that our learned indexes can have significant advantages over traditional
  indexes. More importantly, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of
  a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for
  future systems designs and that this work provides just a glimpse of what might be
  possible.},

  abstract = {Indexes are a critical component of data management applications. While tree-like
  structures (e.g., B-Trees) have been employed to great success, recent work suggests
  that index structures powered by machine learning models (learned index structures)
  can achieve low lookup times with a reduced memory footprint. This demonstration showcases
  CDFShop, a tool to explore and optimize recursive model indexes (RMIs), a type of
  learned index structure. This demonstration allows audience members to (1) gain an
  intuition about various tuning parameters of RMIs and why learned index structures
  can greatly accelerate search, and (2) understand how automatic optimization techniques
  can be used to explore space/time tradeoffs within the space of RMIs.},
