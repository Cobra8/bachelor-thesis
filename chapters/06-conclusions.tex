\section{Conclusion}
% In this work we...
% the big conclusion: we need floating point arithmetic in network switches to allow learned index structures
% learned two new programming languages (picked up quite a bit of Rust + completely discovevered and learned about P4) for this work and definately got more familiar with C++

\section{Future Work}
% The continuation of this work includes...

% the fact that our solution could potentially perform RMI lookups for packets "on the fly" (when we could fit calculations into 32 stages and all other conditions)
% 16-bit floating point arithmetic paper
% RMI related paper that proposes better layer configurations then offered by the reference implementation adapted in chapter 4
% Finally the big task: getting actual hardware switches to the point that this work demands
%     could be worth giving this a try for a start of a future work by extending the switch / NIC capabilities with verilog
